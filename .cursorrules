# Instructions

During you interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2
Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Also record failed attempts in the scratchpad so that you can refer to them when you try again.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- Python environment is configured by Poetry, so run `poetry run python` to start the python interpreter and run `poetry install` to install the dependencies.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- When installing new packages, use `poetry add <package>` directly instead of manually editing pyproject.toml or poetry.lock files.
- Every time you create a new script, you should first write the script description at the top of the script.

## Cursor learned

- For website image paths, always use the correct relative path (e.g., 'images/filename.png') and ensure the images directory exists
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- When scraping modern web apps, Playwright is often more reliable than Selenium for handling dynamic content and Angular/React apps
- When scraping React-based tables, look for role-based selectors (e.g., role="table", role="row", role="cell") instead of traditional HTML selectors
- When scraping tables, always inspect the actual HTML structure to determine correct cell indices, as visual column order may not match the DOM structure
- When dealing with toggle buttons, verify the actual state/effect of the button rather than assuming the button text matches its action
- When scraping pattern/tag data, check for and handle placeholder values (e.g., "***") that should be filtered out
- When dealing with dropdown menus in modern web apps, try multiple selector strategies (text content, role, class names) as the actual implementation may vary
- When scraping dynamic content, add appropriate waits between actions to allow for animations and content loading
- When scraping problem lists, avoid clicking individual problem links if only the list data is needed
- When dealing with dynamic web apps, using JavaScript directly through page.evaluate() can be more reliable than Playwright's built-in selectors
- When scraping large lists, scroll elements into view before interacting with them to ensure they're accessible
- When writing web scraping scripts, make them general and reusable by parameterizing the target (e.g., which tab to scrape)
- When scraping websites that require authentication, try using their public API (e.g., GraphQL) first as it might not require authentication
- When dealing with rate limits or authentication issues, using official APIs is often more reliable than web scraping
- When formatting percentages, use consistent decimal places (e.g., "%.1f%%" for one decimal place)
- When handling large datasets, use appropriate data structures and batch processing to improve performance
- When creating a Flask application with WebSockets, use eventlet as the async mode for better compatibility
- On macOS, port 5000 is often used by AirPlay Receiver, so use a different port (e.g., 5001) for Flask applications
- When displaying AI agent outputs, categorize different message types (steps, code, execution, etc.) for better visualization
- When creating web interfaces for AI applications, Gradio provides a simpler and more consistent experience than Flask for rapid prototyping
- When using Gradio's Timer component, use the component.update(function, every=seconds) syntax instead of gr.Timer(interval=seconds)
- When capturing output from AI agents in Gradio, use both print function overriding and sys.stdout.write patching to ensure all outputs are captured
- For real-time updates in Gradio, use a hidden button with JavaScript to trigger periodic refreshes rather than relying on Gradio's built-in Timer

## Current Task: Create Frontend for Open Deep Research Application

### Requirements:
- Create a web-based frontend for the Open Deep Research application
- Integrate with the existing backend (run.py)
- Provide a user-friendly interface for submitting research questions
- Display real-time updates of the research process
- Support multiple language models

### Plan:
[X] Create directory structure for Flask application
[X] Create main Flask application (app.py)
[X] Create HTML template (index.html)
[X] Create CSS styles (style.css)
[X] Create JavaScript for frontend functionality (main.js)
[X] Create requirements.txt for dependencies
[X] Create README.md for documentation
[X] Create run.sh script for easy startup
[X] Make run.sh executable
[X] Test the application
[X] Enhance message display to show detailed step information
[X] Create Gradio-based implementation to match Hugging Face Space
[X] Fix Gradio implementation issues
[X] Improve Gradio app to show all information during the research process

### Progress:
- Created Flask application with WebSocket support
- Created responsive UI with sidebar and main content area
- Implemented real-time updates using Socket.IO
- Added support for multiple language models
- Added research history tracking with localStorage
- Added proper error handling and progress tracking
- Fixed issues with eventlet compatibility by using threading mode
- Changed port from 5000 to 5001 to avoid conflicts with AirPlay Receiver on macOS
- Successfully tested the application
- Enhanced message display to show detailed step information, tool usage, and execution logs
- Added CSS styling for different message types for better visualization
- Created a Gradio-based implementation to match the Hugging Face Space behavior
- Implemented markdown formatting for different message types in Gradio
- Fixed issues with the Gradio Timer component by using the component.update() method
- Fixed browser configuration and tool initialization in the Gradio implementation
- Properly configured the model dropdown to avoid warnings
- Enhanced the Gradio app to show all information during the research process by:
  - Improving the output capture mechanism to catch all agent outputs
  - Adding more message type categorization for better formatting
  - Patching both print and sys.stdout.write to ensure all outputs are captured
  - Adding a manual refresh button for users to update the output display
  - Using JavaScript to automatically refresh the output every second

### Completed Task:
The frontend for the Open Deep Research application has been successfully created and tested. We've implemented two versions:
1. A Flask-based version with WebSocket support for real-time updates
2. A Gradio-based version that matches the behavior of the Hugging Face Space

Both implementations provide a user-friendly interface for submitting research questions, display real-time updates of the research process with detailed step information, and support multiple language models. The frontends integrate with the existing backend (run.py) to perform web research using SmolaGents.

The Gradio implementation has been enhanced to show all information during the research process, including step headers, thought processes, code blocks, execution outputs, tool calls, and the final answer. This provides users with a comprehensive view of the research process and helps them understand how the AI arrived at its conclusions.
