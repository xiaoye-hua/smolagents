─────────────────────────────────────────────────── Initial plan ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Here is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:
                ```
                1. Use the “search_agent” to locate the official proceedings, schedules, and any industry track 
listings for KDD 2023, KDD 2024, RecSys 2023, and RecSys 2024.  
2. Identify and collect any papers, workshops, or tutorials focusing on integrating or combining LLMs with 
recommendation systems; specifically prioritize works from industry or with strong industry collaborations.  
3. For each relevant item found, use “inspect_file_as_text” if necessary (e.g., to read PDF or other accessible 
files) to extract details:  
   - Title  
   - Company/Organization  
   - Published Year  
   - Conference (KDD/RecSys)  
   - High-Level Idea (brief summary)  
   - (Optional) Number of Citations (if available)  
4. Compile the extracted data into a structured table matching the required format.  
5. Synthesize an analysis of how these works integrate LLMs into recommendation systems, noting distinct approaches, 
shared techniques, challenges, and any common themes of real-world applications.  
6. Determine which works have drawn the most attention, referencing citation counts or other impact indicators, and 
briefly explain possible reasons for their prominence.  
7. Present the final structured table and analysis in a comprehensive answer using “final_answer.”  


                ```

Output message of the LLM: ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Thought: I will call the “search_agent” team member to look for any industry-focused works (papers, workshops,       
tutorials) at KDD 2023, KDD 2024, RecSys 2023, and RecSys 2024 dealing with Large Language Models for recommendation 
systems. Then I will parse the results, compile them into a table, and provide the requested summary.
